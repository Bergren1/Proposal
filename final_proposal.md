# Final Project Proposal

## Part:1

### What are you going to do for the final project?
*For my final project, I wanted to look at life expectancy by county in the United States, and compare it with the distribution of healthcare facilities in the country. Next, I would like to analyze several different major metropolitan areas to visualize the nuances of urbancommunity health. I believe that this would lend itself well to several of the analysis types that we have done in this class, such as hexagonal (especially with the incorporated 3d modeling that one student did for their first project.),
spatial Auto-Correlation.*


**What is your question?**
*I have a few questions: How is life expectancy distributed spatially? Hospitals? Do these things have a relationship? Does access to healthcare influence life expectancy? or do lack of resources influence both?*


**Where is the data coming from? Provide links? If you don’t have - or can’t find - the data, pick a different project.**
*Most of it comes from the United States gov, but here are links:

**What three non-superficial elements from the class are you going to incorporate? Python? SQL? Moran’s I? 3D mapping? Hexagonal analysis? Analysis in GeoDa? Something else? (Non-superficial meaning doing more than importing the data with python.)**

*SQL: Organization
Python: Adding/ selecting desired features data. I can pull out counties with X number of hospitals or Y> life expectancies.
Hexagons: Good Visualization tool for distribution of Hospitals
GeoDa: regressions would be a great tool here. Is inequality of health regional, or just county based?*


**How will you know when you’ve answered your question?**

*If I have a series of maps that are instantly recognizable as showing health inequality across the country, I would say that I have done my job.*

## Part:2

**What other component from the class will you incorporate?**

*Besides what is listed above, I think that a heat map would be pretty neat to incorporate, as well as some of the other types of Spatial analysis from that lab.*

**Why is more involved than the labs?**

*I will be doing a lot more types of analysis that the labs required. Showing data multiple ways can often have a far greater impact.*

**Why did you choose this component?**

*As mentioned above, It is an appropriate type of analysis for the project I am doing, and the more different ways to illustrate a point, the better it will be.*

## Part:3

**Go above and beyond and trying something new - explain what it is that you learned on your own here.**

*I would really enjoy making a cartogram for this project, as I have always appreciated the visualization, but have never been taught how to actually make one. QGIS has a plugin that I plan to use to add an extra emphasis to the rest of my project.*
